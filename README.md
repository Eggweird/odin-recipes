# odin-recipes

This project is to create a basic recipe website that will showcase what I have learned so far in The Odin Project. Utilizing <img> to post images on the page. Using relative pathing to post those images to the html page. Also utilizing unordered and ordered list to list out ingredients an directions of the food.

Things I can improve on would be to start using comments on my code. I think it would be a good idea to comment on my code since for future reference when I look at the code again I would generally have a good idea on what the code does. It would also help people reading my code to understand it as well.
