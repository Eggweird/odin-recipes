<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is a soft tofu stew that is very versatile in what you would want to put inside the soup.
    The soup itself is a rather simple base that can have additions to your liking. 
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>8 large dried anchovies, heads and guts removed</li>
    <li>5 ounces of radish, peeled, washed, and sliced thinly</li>
    <li>dried kelp (6 x 4 inch piece)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Korean hot pepper flakes (gochugaru)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1/2 cup pork belly (or any cut of pork: 2.5 ounces), cut into small pieces</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped onion</li>
    <li>1 clove minced garlic/li>
    <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 cup well-fermented kimchi (4 ounces), chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>1 tube of soft tofu (sundubu)</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Put dried anchovies, radish, dried kelp, and 4 cups of water in a pot. Cover and boil over medium high heat for 10 minutes until it starts boiling.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat to low and boil another 20 minutes</li>
    <li>Remove from the heat and strain. It will make about 2 cups of stock.</li>
    <li>Combine the hot pepper flakes and the sesame oil in a small bowl and mix well.</li>
    <li>Heat up a 3 cup earthenware pot (ttukbaegi) on the stove over medium high heat for about 3 to 4 minutes. If you use a small heavy pan or pot, it will take less.</li>
    <li>Add the vegetable oil, onion, and garlic. Stir it with a wooden spoon for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add the pork. Stir for 3 minutes until the pork is no longer pink.</li>
    <li>Add kimchi and keep stirring for a minute. Add 1/2 cup anchovy stock. Cover and cook for 7 minutes over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Add the salt and the sugar and mix well.</li>
    <li>Cut the tube of soft tofu into half and squeeze it out into the pot. Gently break up the tofu with a wooden spoon. If you want, add a few tablespoons of stock.</li>
    <li>Put the hot pepper mixture on top and spread it with the spoon.
    </li>
    <li>Crack the egg and put it on top, in the center of the stew. Let it bubble and sizzle for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with the chopped green onion and serve with rice and a few more side dishes.</li>
